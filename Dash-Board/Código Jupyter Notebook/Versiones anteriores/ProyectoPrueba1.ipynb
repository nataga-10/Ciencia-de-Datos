The Newzoo report for 2023 [reveals](<https://newzoo.com/resources/trend-reports/newzoo-global-games-market-report-2023-free-version>) that two in five \\u2014 more than three billion \\u2014 across the globe are gamers, which is 6.3 percent more than last year.\\n\\nGlobally, gaming revenue amounts to an estimated [US$242.39 billion](<https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-game-market>), with almost half of that generated by the Asia Pacific. By the year 2030, this worldwide total is expected to more than double to US$583.69 billion.\\n\\nNew game titles have appeared this year, such as _The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom_, _Hogwarts Legacy_ and _Star Wars Jedi: Survivor_, while older titles have continued to be popular with fans. Millions around the world are still building new worlds in _Minecraft_ and honing their skills in multiplayer online battle arenas, such as _Defense of the Ancients (DOTA 2)_, and tactical shooters, such as _Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO)_, with the latter only [growing in popularity](<https://www.statista.com/statistics/808630/csgo-number-players-steam/>).\\n\\nWith the revenue and the number of gamers on the rise, the gaming industry continues to be a lucrative target for cybercriminals, with long-awaited and just popular titles being used as a lure in malicious campaigns. Given that nearly a quarter of players [were underage](<https://www.statista.com/statistics/189582/age-of-us-video-game-players/>) as of 2022, they may be easy prey for the attackers. In this report, we provide our insights into the gaming-related threat landscape in 2023.\\n\\n## Methodology\\n\\nTo gain an insight into the current landscape of gaming-related cybersecurity risks, Kaspersky has conducted extensive research into prevalent threats targeting the gaming community. Our investigation encompassed attacks that involved threats disguised as game apps, mods and cheats, and features analysis of some of the most active malware families operating in this domain. We also analyzed phishing pages using various game titles and gaming platforms as a lure. Our analysis drew on data sourced from the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN), which is a system for processing anonymized cyberthreat-related data shared voluntarily by Kaspersky users, from July 1, 2022 to July 1, 2023.\\n\\nKaspersky experts researched threats related to the top 14 games available for download or poised for release on streaming platforms, such as Origin and Steam, as well as platform-agnostic titles, to provide a comprehensive overview of current threats. The list of titles is based on several rankings of the most popular games available on the internet.\\n\\nOur team analyzed threats associated with mobile (where applicable) and desktop versions of _Minecraft_, _Roblox_, _Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO)_, _PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds (PUBG)_, _Hogwarts Legacy_, _Defense of the Ancients 2 (DOTA 2)_, _League of Legends_, _World of Warcraft_, _Apex Legends_, _Diablo IV_, _Star Wars Jedi: Survivor_, _The Legend of Zelda_, _Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3_ and _Final Fantasy XVI_.\\n\\n## Key findings\\n\\nFrom July 1, 2022 to July 1, 2023:\\n\\n  * In total, Kaspersky detected 4,076,530 game-related desktop infection attempts over the past year, which affected 192,456 gamers worldwide.\\n  * The most common threat was Downloaders (89.70%), followed by Adware (5.25%) and Trojans (2.39%).\\n  * The top game used as a lure was _Minecraft_, which saw 70.29% of all detections, followed by _Roblox_ (20.37%), _Counter-Strike: Global Offensive_ (4.78%) and _PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds_ (2.85%).\\n  * Our mobile solutions detected 436,786 gaming-related infection attempts that affected 84,539 users.\\n  * _Minecraft_ users (90.37%) were the biggest targets for mobile malware, with _PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds_ (5.09%), _Roblox_ (3.33%) and _Baldur&#x27;s Gate_ (0.68%) being the next most often used lures.\\n\\n## Desktop statistics: _Minecraft_ still a big malware target\\n\\nFrom July 1, 2022 to July 1, 2023, Kaspersky solutions detected 4,076,530 attempts to download a total of 30,684 unique files, which were being distributed under the guise of popular games or mods, cheats and other game-related software, and affected 192,456 users worldwide. Most of these files were unwanted software called &quot;Downloaders&quot; (89.70%). Not dangerous in itself, this type of software downloads various other programs including malware onto the device. Adware (5.25%) and Trojans (2.39%) were also in the top three desktop gaming-related threats.\\n\\n_TOP 10 threats using popular games as a lure, July 1, 2022 to July 1, 2023 ([download](<https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30210351/01-en-gaming-report-data.png>))_\\n\\nOf the 14 games we chose for this research, _Minecraft_ (70.29%) remained the most popular one with cybercriminals. This evergreen sandbox game has more than [160 million](<https://activeplayer.io/minecraft/>) monthly active players in 2023, and is still one of the world&#x27;s most-played computer games. Threats using this game as a lure affected 130,619 users globally during the reporting period.\\n\\nMalware and unwanted software mentioning _Roblox_ \\u2013 the second most-targeted game title \\u2013 in file names triggered 20.37% of alerts on the computers of 30,367 users, followed by _Counter-Strike: Global Offensive_ (4.78%), _PUBG_ (2.85%), _Hogwarts Legacy_ (0.60%), _DOTA 2_ (0.45%) and _League of Legends_ (0.31%).\\n\\n_Games by number of related threat detections, July 1, 2022 to July 1, 2023 ([download](<https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30210421/02-en-gaming-report-data.png>))_\\n\\n**Game title** | **Unique users**  \\n---|---  \\nMinecraft | 130,619  \\nRoblox | 30,367  \\nCS:GO | 23,429  \\nPUBG | 5,891  \\nHogwarts Legacy | 4,007  \\nDOTA 2 | 1,922  \\nLeague of Legends | 986  \\nWorld of Warcraft | 387  \\nApex Legends | 322  \\nDiablo IV | 264  \\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor | 216  \\nLegend of Zelda | 214  \\nBaldur&#x27;s Gate 3 | 153  \\nFinal Fantasy XVI | 7  \\n  \\n_Games by number of users affected by related threats, July1, 2022 to July 1, 2023_\\n\\n**Game title** | **Unique files**  \\n---|---  \\nMinecraft | 14,405  \\nRoblox | 8,682  \\nCS:GO | 4,498  \\nPUBG | 2,569  \\nHogwarts Legacy | 945  \\nLeague of Legends | 523  \\nDOTA 2 | 418  \\nApex Legends | 350  \\nWorld of Warcraft | 263  \\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor | 88  \\nDiablo IV | 54  \\nBaldur&#x27;s Gate 3 | 53  \\nLegend of Zelda | 37  \\nFinal Fantasy XVI | 6  \\n  \\n_Games by number of unique files using their name as a lure, July1, 2022 to July 1, 2023_\\n\\n## Mobile gaming-related threats\\n\\nThe [mobile gaming](<https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-media/video-games/mobile-games/worldwide>) community, playing video games on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, has become a driving force since the pandemic. As it offers convenient and accessible gaming anywhere, it is attracting big user numbers around the world, especially in the United States and Asia Pacific. According to Statista, the number of mobile gamers is to reach 2.3 billion by 2027.\\n\\nAlthough not all games on our list are officially ported to mobile phones and tablets, with some mobile versions [shut down](<https://esports.gg/news/apex-legends/apex-legends-mobile-shut-down/>) soon after being launched or even [on the development stage](<https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/3/23290523/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-mobile-canceled-netease>), every now and then third party mobile adaptations appear, as well as malicious traps for those willing to know if it is at all possible to play the game on mobile.\\n\\n### Mobile statistics\\n\\nFrom July 1, 2022 to July 1, 2023 Kaspersky solutions detected 436,786 attempts to infect mobile devices of 84,539 users. Most of the researched game titles were used as a lure for mobile gamers at least once.\\n\\n_Games by number of related mobile malware and unwanted software detections, July 1, 2022 to July 1, 2023 ([download](<https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30210452/03-en-gaming-report-data.png>))_\\n\\nOnce again, _Minecraft_ players were the primary targets, with 90.37% of attacks relating to this title. These attacks impacted 80,128 gamers.\\n\\nIn one instance, Indonesian mobile gamers were targeted by cybercriminals who used _Minecraft _as their gateway for Trojan.AndroidOS.Pootel.a, which opens the Minecraft page in an alternative application marketplace when the application launches on the user&#x27;s phone.\\n\\nThen, by using malicious code, it begins to quietly register mobile subscriptions. To obtain the phone number, which is necessary for completing a subscription, the application uses the Google Phone Number Hint API. It then opens the subscription activation page in an invisible window and inserts the received user number into the appropriate field. After that, it clicks the _Subscribe_ button, intercepts the confirmation code from an incoming text message and pastes it into the required field on the confirmation page.\\n\\nKaspersky gaming threat research also revealed that the most frequently targeted mobile _Minecraft_ gamers were those from the Islamic Republic of Iran. In this country, 140,482 alerts were triggered, impacting 54,467 Minecrafters.\\n\\n_PUBG: Battlegrounds Battle Royale_ \\u2013 the second most popular mobile game recorded by Kaspersky \\u2013 logged 5.09% of all alerts, most of these coming from players in the Russian Federation.\\n\\n_Roblox_ (3.33%) was third by number of detections, but second by number of affected users \\u2013 2351 against 1294 for _PUBG_. One of the malware families targeting _Roblox_ fans, was the SpyNote spy Trojan, which was being distributed among users under the guise of a mod. It has a number of spying capabilities, such as logging keystrokes, recording the screen and broadcasting video from phone cameras, and it can also imitate the official Google and Facebook apps to trick the user into revealing their passwords.\\n\\nThe fourth most-targeted mobile game was _Baldur&#x27;s Gate_ (0.68%), a role-playing video game series set in a forgotten realm&#x27;s dungeons and dragons world, which does not have an official mobile version. Most of the affected gamers were located in Russian Federation, Brazil and Turkey.\\n\\n**Game title** | **Unique users**  \\n---|---  \\nMinecraft | 80,128  \\nRoblox | 2,351  \\nPUBG | 1,294  \\nBaldur&#x27;s Gate 3 | 304  \\nFinal Fantasy VI | 115  \\nDiablo IV | 108  \\nCS:GO | 72  \\nLegend of Zelda | 63  \\nApex Legends | 29  \\nDota 2 | 27  \\nLeague of Legends | 26  \\nWorld of Warcraft | 19  \\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor | 3  \\n  \\n_Games by number of unique users targeted by game-related threats, July 1, 2022 to July 1, 2023_\\n\\n## Phishing: get scammed for free\\n\\nIn this section, we provide insights into phishing campaigns that use some of the 14 games covered in the report, along with some other titles, as a lure.\\n\\n### Fake game distribution pages\\n\\nMalicious and unwanted software disguised as popular games is often distributed by third-party websites that offer pirated versions of the titles. In the screenshot below, you can see examples of such websites, offering to download _Atomic Heart_, _CS:GO_ and _Euro Truck Simulator_ &quot;for free&quot;.\\n\\n[![](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30161931/Gaming_report_01-1024x871.jpeg)](<https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30161931/Gaming_report_01.jpeg>)\\n\\nSome of these pages show a relatively high number of downloads below the _Download_ button, most likely to assure the user that the software is safe. Clicking the button downloads an archive, which may contain unwanted or even dangerous software, but not necessarily the game itself.\\n\\n[![](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30161958/Gaming_report_02-1024x656.jpeg)](<https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30161958/Gaming_report_02.jpeg>)\\n\\n### Hunting for gaming accounts\\n\\nAs most games allow users to purchase and sell valuable in-game items, gaming accounts are a lucrative target for cybercriminals, especially those that contain a good collection of popular titles in addition to a linked credit card.\\n\\nOne of the most popular lures in case of games is free giveaway of in-game items or skins. The generous offers on the screenshots below will most probably result in your Steam or Riot Games account being stolen. The scheme is simple: to take part in the fake giveaway, you have to sign in to your account, which means entering your credentials on the phishing website.\\n\\n[![](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30162024/Gaming_report_03-1024x553.jpeg)](<https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30162024/Gaming_report_03.jpeg>)\\n\\n_Counter-Strike_ fans are often targeted with &quot;free&quot; skins, which may be valuable property in this game. Last year, a user [lost two million dollars&#x27; worth of skins](<https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/cs-go-two-million-usd-inventory-hack/44697/>) after their account was hacked. Unfortunately, those falling for phishers&#x27; offers will lose what they already have rather than get a valuable skin for free.\\n\\n[![](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30162048/Gaming_report_04-1024x413.jpeg)](<https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30162048/Gaming_report_04.jpeg>)\\n\\nAnother site offers something named &quot;_Counter-Strike 2_ limited test&quot;, but only to those who are willing to link their Steam account. However, if a user does link it, it will be compromised, and no access to the beta version of the game will be granted.\\n\\n[![](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30162119/Gaming_report_05-1024x819.png)](<https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30162119/Gaming_report_05.png>)\\n\\nBesides gaming accounts, cybercriminals target gamers&#x27; social media profiles. These are valuable to the fraudsters, as they typically contain a lot of personal data and linked payment details. Moreover, social media accounts are often used to sign in to other services including online games. Last but not least, through a stolen social media account, cybercriminals can target the victim&#x27;s friends and relatives with various scams.\\n\\n[![](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30162149/Gaming_report_06-1024x819.png)](<https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30162149/Gaming_report_06.png>)\\n\\nIn the screenshot above, phishers lure _PUBG_ players with an in-game item giveaway. To participate, you need to sign in to your Facebook, X (ex-Twitter) or other social media account on the fake website. As soon as you do that, your credentials will be stolen.\\n\\n### Gaming-related scams\\n\\nSimilar bait is used in scams where users are tricked into paying cybercriminals a certain amount of money to obtain a gift card, in-game currency or a brand-new game. Typically, on such websites, you need to first enter some personal details and fill out a simple survey. A page is then shown, telling you that you have won a valuable prize. The only thing left to do before you can claim it is pay a small delivery fee. However, by doing this, a victim not only loses the money paid, but also compromises their bank card.\\n\\nIn the screenshot below, you can see a typical example of this scam. The cybercriminals offer users &quot;free _Apex Legends_ gift cards&quot;. To get those, you have to first enter your username, then answer several questions and pay for your prize.\\n\\n[![](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30162238/Gaming_report_07-1024x409.jpeg)](<https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30162238/Gaming_report_07.jpeg>)\\n\\nTo Roblox players, the fraudsters often offer to earn, generate or just get some _Robux_ (_Roblox_ in-game currency) for free. Similarly to the _Apex Legends_ example, if a user tries to withdraw the &quot;earned&quot; or generated money, they have to make a payment on a fraudulent website.\\n\\n[![](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30162301/Gaming_report_08-1024x659.jpeg)](<https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30162301/Gaming_report_08.jpeg>)\\n\\nAnother option scammers often resort to, is offering a hefty discount for a hot title. In the screenshot below, a rogue website pretends to be selling _Star Wars Jedi: Survivor_ for $28.7, which is less than a half of the official price.\\n\\n[![](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30162332/Gaming_report_09-1024x415.png)](<https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/30162332/Gaming_report_09.png>)\\n\\nShould the user pay, most likely, they will get nothing, but lose their money and bank card details.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nGaming platforms have always been attractive targets for cybercriminals as they store a wealth of personal and financial data that ranges from payment details to email addresses and other personally identifiable information. Fraudsters make money by stealing in-game items and currency, which often have real-world value, or selling hacked accounts.\\n\\nCybercriminals are also increasingly using games \\u2013 such as _Minecraft_ and _Roblox_ \\u2013 aimed at young audiences, as a lure to exploit inexperienced computer users who lack cybersecurity awareness, with malicious or unwanted software.\\n\\nWith this in mind, it is imperative that young gamers&#x27; parents educate themselves, so they can help protect their kids. There is a plethora of excellent resources online explaining the major threats to help new gamers have fun and stay safe, even if you are not a natural techie.\\n\\n**To keep your kids safe online, Kaspersky recommends that users:**\\n\\n  * Show interest in their kids&#x27; online activities. Ask them if you can watch their favorite series or listen to music tracks together. As an option, you can learn some secure practices to stay safe online together.\\n  * Explore the option of [parental control apps](<https://www.kaspersky.com/safe-kids>) allowing you to control your kid&#x27;s online activity. When going down that route, it is essential to discuss the subject with the child to explain how these apps work and why they are needed to keep them safe online.\\n  * Explain to their kids what sensitive information is and why it should only be shared with people they know in real life. You can be a role model and show your children examples of proper behavior.\\n  * Spend more time talking to your kids about ways to be safe online. Try paying attention to your own habits. Do you use your smartphone while eating or talking? Are your kids mimicking any of your habits or behavior patterns? Do they react in a different way when you put your phone away?\\n  * Make conversations about cybersecurity more enjoyable and exciting by discussing them with your child through games and other [entertaining formats](<https://www.kaspersky.com/acq/midorikuma/kaspersky-midori-kuma-and-a-very-special-race.html>).\\n\\nThat being said, it is worth keeping in mind that it is not just young gamers that are targeted. Cybercriminals often seek to infect as many machines as possible and steal as many accounts as possible. Moreover, grown-up gamers often invest more money in their hobby, so their accounts are a more attractive target than those of kids. That is why it is important to stay vigilant, avoid downloading anything from shady third-party websites or sharing any personal details with those. Needless to say, the developers of gaming cheats and hacks may well cheat on their audience themselves, so you should think twice before downloading software like that.\\n\\n**To stay safe while gaming, Kaspersky recommends: **\\n\\n  * Download your games from official stores like Steam, Apple App Store, Google Play or Amazon Appstore only. Games from these marketplaces are not 100% safe, but they at least are checked by store representatives and there is some kind of screening system: not every app can get listed.\\n  * If you wish to buy a game that is not available through the major stores, purchase it from the official website only. Double-check the URL of the website and make sure it is authentic. To additionally protect your purchases, use online banking protection, such as Safe Money feature in Kaspersky products.\\n  * Beware of phishing campaigns and unfamiliar gamers. Do not open links received by email or in a game chat unless you trust the sender. Do not open files you get from strangers.\\n  * Do not download pirated software or any other illegal content, even if you are redirected to it from a legitimate website. It&#x27;s safer to buy games only on official sites and wait for the sales \\u2014 they regularly take place, so you won&#x27;t be sitting on your hands for long.\\n  * Use a strong, reliable security solution, which will not slow down your computer while you are playing, while protecting you from malware, phishing and other threats. As an example, [Kaspersky Premium](<https://usa.kaspersky.com/premium?reseller=usa_bb2022-press-rel_pr_ona_oth__onl_b2b_press-release_nl____kprem___&utm_source=press-release&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=us_bb2022-press-rel_aa0194&utm_content=link&utm_term=us_press-release_organic_nvp194zv6mj7upj>) works smoothly with Steam and other gaming services, and can protect computers and mobile devices.\",\n",

Having a baby really resets your expectations for &quot;keeping up&quot; with the world. From November through mid-January or so I had no idea what was going on with the outside world, I only cared about my daughter&#x27;s feeding schedule and tried to squeeze in 30-minute naps where I could.\\n\\nI&#x27;ve slowly started to re-introduce myself to social media and the news world at large over the past few weeks so my return to work wasn&#x27;t so abrupt, and I missed quite a bit. There was a stretch there where I was only getting the latest headlines from Weekend Update on &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot;\\n\\nMy teammates Madison Burns and Bill Largent did a fantastic job filling in for me on the newsletter while I was out, but I figured it was worth taking the time to recap some major stories it seemed like I missed since Nov. 1.\\n\\nMaybe our readers were also distracted during this period, it was the holidays after all and it&#x27;s easy for stories to slip through the cracks while we all have so much going on. Here are a few major trends and storylines that stood out to me while I caught up on the top security stories of late 2022 and early 2023.\\n\\n  * **The Russia-Ukraine war continues to evolve on all fronts**, and the cyber attacks certainly haven&#x27;t slowed. Ukraine reported several [state-sponsored attacks in early 2023](<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-links-data-wiping-attack-on-news-agency-to-russian-hackers/?ref=cisco-talos-blog>), including against the country&#x27;s national news agency. The infamous [WhisperGate malware came back](<https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/08/whispergate-hackers-data-stealing-malware-ukraine/?ref=cisco-talos-blog>), too, looking to wipe data and steal sensitive information from high-profile Ukrainian targets. And the [Gamaredon APT](<https://therecord.media/russia-backed-hacker-group-gamaredon-attacking-ukraine-with-info-stealing-malware/?ref=cisco-talos-blog>) continues to do its thing. Thankfully, defenders made some headway in combatting Russian state-sponsored groups, as I&#x27;ll cover below.\\n  * **The spyware industry [boomed in 2022](<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/us/politics/spyware-nso-pegasus-paragon.html?ref=cisco-talos-blog>)** and I suspect we&#x27;ll be hearing a lot about it going forward. This type of borderline-illegal software installed on users&#x27; phones can track their every move and message and is often used to target high-profile users like politicians, activists and journalists. Spyware is proliferating all over the world and is now being used by many countries&#x27; governments, including the U.S. But President Joe Biden&#x27;s administration has [several moves in the works](<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/22/how-biden-administration-wants-tackle-foreign-commercial-spyware/?ref=cisco-talos-blog>) to try and combat foreign company&#x27;s spyware from making onto Americans&#x27; phones.\\n  * **The Lapsus$ ransomware group is still one of the most prolific threat actors out there.** Cisco Talos researchers have extensively covered Lapsus$ throughout 2022, but it struck several times in late 2022 and early 2023, including threatening to [leak &quot;League of Legends&#x27;&quot; source code](<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/riot-games-receives-ransom-demand-from-hackers-refuses-to-pay/?ref=cisco-talos-blog>) and [breaching authentication company Okta](<https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/22/okta-breach-source-code-github/?ref=cisco-talos-blog>). That&#x27;s on top of other major attacks from earlier in &#x27;22 against T-Mobile, Uber and more.\\n  * AI is all over the place, from art, to voice acting and now full-on search engines. One of the most controversial tools, ChatGPT, has [already entered the malware space](<https://gizmodo.com/chatgpt-ai-polymorphic-malware-computer-virus-cyber-1850012195?ref=cisco-talos-blog>). The chatbot, released in November, has already shown it can write &quot;polymorphic&quot; malware that can repeatedly mutate to avoid traditional detection methods. Scammers and threat actors are also using  ChatGPT to [generate convincing spear-phishing emails](<https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/opwnai-cybercriminals-starting-to-use-chatgpt/?ref=cisco-talos-blog>) quickly and impersonate people the targeted user may personally know.\\n\\n## The one big thing\\n\\n[This month&#x27;s Microsoft Patch Tuesday](<https://blog.talosintelligence.com/microsoft-patch-tuesday-for-january-2023-snort-rules-and-prominent-vulnerabilities/>) updates included three zero-day vulnerabilities that the company says are being actively used in attacks in the wild. CVE-2023-23376, CVE-2023-21715 and CVE-2023-21823 have all already been spotted in active attacks, according to Microsoft&#x27;s monthly patch release. In all, Microsoft disclosed 73 vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, eight are classified as &quot;critical,&quot; 64 are classified as &quot;important&quot; and one vulnerability is classified as &quot;moderate.&quot;\\n\\n### Why do I care?\\n\\nThe most severe of the issues disclosed Tuesday is CVE-2023-21823, a Windows graphics component remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain System-level privileges. Outside of that, it&#x27;s always important to update all Microsoft products anyway after a Patch Tuesday.\\n\\n### So now what?\\n\\nUsers of any Microsoft products should apply these updates as soon as possible. Additionally, Talos released new Snort rules that detect attempts to exploit some of these vulnerabilities. Cisco Secure Firewall customers should use the latest update to their ruleset by updating their SRU. Open-source Snort Subscriber Rule Set customers can stay up to date by downloading the latest rule pack available for purchase on Snort.org.\\n\\n## Top security headlines of the week\\n\\nSeveral Russian nationals are facing new sanctions and have been unmasked as members of the Trickbot and Conti ransomware gangs. The actors are involved in various activities with these groups, ranging from developing ransomware code, to money laundering and managing command and control servers. The U.S. and U.K. governments also made a renewed push to unmask and name many of these actors, removing their anonymity and making it more difficult for them to operate in secrecy. Recent studies have shown that these types of sanctions are working to slow Russian state-sponsored ransomware attacks. ([Wired](<https://www.wired.com/story/conti-trickbot-ransomware-sanctions-uk-us/?ref=cisco-talos-blog>), [CPO Magazine](<https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/more-russian-hackers-hit-with-sanctions-as-trickbot-ransomware-gang-members-make-the-list/?ref=cisco-talos-blog>))\\n\\nWhile much of the headlines recently have centered around the infamous Chinese spy balloon and other unknown objects the U.S. military keeps shooting out of the sky, global government officials are warning that China&#x27;s cyber attack capabilities are still the most pressing threat. Taiwan&#x27;s government has already been the target of several high-profile defacement attacks in recent years, and the country recently established an entirely new government bureau to bolster its cyber security capabilities. The FBI&#x27;s Director is also offering new services and olive branches to private security companies who are looking to combat China&#x27;s growing surveillance and cyber capabilities.

For now Riot, stewards of titles such as Valorant and League of Legends, made the following statement in relation to the attack:\\n\\n> Earlier this week, systems in our development environment were compromised via a social engineering attack. We don&#x27;t have all the answers right now, but we wanted to communicate early and let you know there is no indication that player data or personal information was obtained.\\n\\nWe may not be told the full details of what exactly took place here. Based on how these things usually tend to go, social engineering launched via an email sent directly to an employee could be a strong candidate.\\n\\nHaving said that, games publishers and developers make use of everything from social media to Discord for keeping in touch with players and fans. It could just as easily be that this began in a social media direct message and spiralled from there.\\n\\n## Slowdowns expected\\n\\nRiot Games manages a number of incredibly popular online titles. This newly discovered compromise is going to cause some drag and delay in relation to keeping things updated with new content and other under the hood activities.\\n\\n> Unfortunately, this has temporarily affected our ability to release content. While our teams are working hard on a fix, we expect this to impact our upcoming patch cadence across multiple games.\\n\\nLeague of Legends, for example, has a [regular patching cycle](<https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/tags/patch-notes/>) and some of those patches are very large indeed, as you&#x27;d expect for an online game. The League of Legends Twitter account has [already warned of potential impact](<https://twitter.com/LeagueOfLegends/status/1616548964861612033>). Valorant operates in [much the same way](<https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/>). We can expect similar across all titles as resources are used up to ensure the compromise has been fully contained and addressed.\\n\\n## The game developer jackpot\\n\\nGames companies have been major targets for compromise for years, which is only to be expected considering the huge amount of data these organisations have access to. There are so many areas for exploitation, from game platform logins to publisher-centric accounts. You can target a PC running a game with remote code execution, go phishing for two-factor authentication codes, steal an account and sell digital items from its inventory\\u2026the list is endless.\\n\\nThe only good thing here is the low probability of customer data having been grabbed, with the attack instead focusing on the development environment for reasons known only to the attacker. There have been many incidents where attackers poking around behind the scenes have been in an effort to [upload or release rogue files via game titles themselves](<https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2016/02/dayz-in-a-daze-forum-breach-confirmed>).\\n\\nThis hasn&#x27;t happened here, thankfully, and with any luck Riot Games will release additional information as the week goes by.\\n\\n### Update, January 24, 9:03AM (GMT-8)\\n\\nRiot Games updated its Twitter followers regarding the compromise. It confirmed attackers were able to steal code for some its flagship games, League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics (TFT), and a legacy anticheat platform.\\n\\n> As promised, we wanted to update you on the status of last week&#x27;s cyber attack. Over the weekend, our analysis confirmed source code for League, TFT, and a legacy anticheat platform were exfiltrated by the attackers.  \\n  \\n1/7 <https://t.co/IogE05HaD1>\\n> \\n> -- Riot Games (@riotgames) [January 24, 2023](<https://twitter.com/riotgames/status/1617900234734198787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**We don&#x27;t just report on threats--we remove them**\\n\\nCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

From the [Ronin newsletter](<https://roninblockchain.substack.com/p/community-alert-ronin-validators?s=w>):\\n\\n> There has been a security breach on the Ronin Network. Earlier today, we discovered that on March 23rd, Sky Mavis\\u2019s Ronin validator nodes and Axie DAO validator nodes were compromised resulting in 173,600 Ethereum and 25.5M USDC drained from the Ronin bridge in two transactions. The attacker used hacked private keys in order to forge fake withdrawals. We discovered the attack this morning after a report from a user being unable to withdraw 5k ETH from the bridge.\\n\\nThese validator nodes act as a means to prevent criminals making off with lots of money. In order to put together a bogus transaction, they&#x27;d need to gain access to 5 out of 9 validator nodes. The successful attack happened over 2 stages.\\n\\nAn unwary employee provided one foot in the door. An unrevoked permission elsewhere kicked it wide open.\\n\\n## The trap is set\\n\\nAccording to [The Block](<https://www.theblock.co/post/156038/how-a-fake-job-offer-took-down-the-worlds-most-popular-crypto-game>), everything fell into place thanks to a senior engineer at the game developer. Two inside sources claim the engineer was fooled by a fake job offer. In fact, it seems multiple employees were approached and encouraged to put in applications. Scams originating from LinkedIn accounts are popular at the moment. As it happens, this is where scammers tried to persuade various people on the development team.\\n\\nOne individual is all it took to empty out a big slice of cryptocurrency funds. A job offer made after several interviews was enough to convince the victim to get on board. Perhaps the &quot;extremely generous&quot; compensation package offered should have set off some alarm bells. Having said that, anything digital finance related likely has huge amounts of cash available.\\n\\n## We rate this job offer a 4 out of 5\\n\\nUnbeknownst to the engineer, everything came crashing down once they received the job offer. A booby-trapped PDF granted the attackers access to Ronin systems, and they were able to compromise 4 out of the required 5 nodes.\\n\\nJust one node remained to be compromised. How did they do it?\\n\\nStep up to the plate, non-revoked access. When employees leave an organisation, it&#x27;s a good idea to remove access to networks and devices. Unknown entities will happily make use of unattended credentials or permissions. Sure enough, that&#x27;s what happened here.\\n\\n## Nudging a node\\n\\nA [Decentralised Autonomous Organization](<https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-a-dao-and-how-do-they-work/>) (DAO) is a way for people in a community to make decisions on a project. The developers approached an Axie DAO for assistance with transactions in November 2021. Ultimately, this is where the fifth node compromise starts to take shape. The issue isn&#x27;t that the DAO exists. The issue is the permissions granted to the DAO. \\n\\nFrom the Substack post [detailing the attack](<https://roninblockchain.substack.com/p/back-to-building-ronin-security-breach>):\\n\\n> At the time, Sky Mavis controlled 4/9 validators, which would not be enough to forge withdrawals. The validator key scheme is set up to be decentralized so that it limits an attack vector, similar to this one, but the attacker found a backdoor through our gas-free RPC node, which they abused to get the signature for the Axie DAO validator. \\n> \\n> This traces back to November 2021 when Sky Mavis requested help from the Axie DAO to distribute free transactions due to an immense user load. The Axie DAO allowlisted Sky Mavis to sign various transactions on its behalf. This was discontinued in December 2021, but the allowlist access was not revoked.\\n\\n## Who takes the blame?\\n\\nIn April, the US Department of Treasury pinned this one on [North Korean hacking group Lazarus](<https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/14/23025739/north-korean-hacker-lazarus-axie-infinity-cryptocurrency-hack-theft-us-blames>). Research elsewhere details Lazarus attacks on both the [aerospace and defence sector](<https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252522378/ESET-Lazarus-APT-hit-aero-defence-sector-with-fake-job-ads>) involving bogus job posts. There&#x27;s no mention of those attacks having any connection to what happened above. However, the research does highlight further recruitment scams using LinkedIn as the starting point.\\n\\nWhether you&#x27;re operating in a cryptocurrency / web3 realm or not, forgotten permissions could cost you dearly. There&#x27;s also the fake job offer approach to consider, too. In recent months we&#x27;ve seen [other game developers targeted](<https://blog.malwarebytes.com/scams/2021/12/fake-job-interviews-plague-major-game-developers-like-riot-games-and-rockstar/>).
